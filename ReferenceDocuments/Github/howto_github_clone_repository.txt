within Atom.

1. Setup a Github account at Github's website (sign up at the top right of the
page). https://github.com/

2. Install Git https://git-scm.com/downloads. When the installation manager,
asks you for your text editor, select Atom. Later, select allow third party
software.

3. Once you have Atom installed on your computer, type Ctrl+8 on your computer.
Follow the prompts to link Atom with Github and Atom with Git.

4. Find the link for the repository on the Github website. Copy this link.

5. Hit Ctrl+Shift+P on your computer and type Github:Clone.

6. Paste the link from Step 4 into the second dialogue box.

7. You're ready to go! The Github repository can now be directly updated
from Atom.
