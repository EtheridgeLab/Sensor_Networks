Hi there! This is a quick tutorial of things to do in order to push updates to
Github.

1. Add a file/make an update to a file within the current package.

2. Click the "Git icon at the bottom right of your screen.

3. At the top of the screen in the "Unstaged Changes" tab, click on
any of the files you wish to stage and hit Enter. If you wish to stage all
of the documents, click "Stage All".

(Staging is preparing a file for Github comments and commiting to Github)

4. Type a commit message in the commit message dialogue box.

5. Choose a branch to commit to at the bottom right of the screen by clicking
the Branch button (it kind of looks like a tree) and naming the branch. For
the current stage of the project (January 2022), the default main branch is
fine.

6. Click the Push buttom next to the Branch button at the bottom right of the screen.

7. The online Github repository should now be updated.
