how_to_setup_mayfly.txt

The LearnEnviroDIYcode-master folder was developed by EnviroDIY and Stroud
Water Research Center to set up the Mayfly and learn how to use it.

For this project, we will use the first 4 tutorials and an SDI-12 address
change script.

To setup the Mayfly, you will need:

1. EnviroDIY Mayfly microcontroller

2. One USB C data and power cable (one side USB C, one side whatever
plugs into your computer)

3. One coin battery (CR1220, 3V lithium coin cell battery, 12 mm, as said
by EnviroDIY)

4. One METER Group Hydros-21 CTD sensor
