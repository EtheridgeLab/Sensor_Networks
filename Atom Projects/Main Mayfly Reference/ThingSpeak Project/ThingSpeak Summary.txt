This is the primary project that should be used to program the Mayfly assemblies out at WRC.


The files in the src folder that end in GW1 through GW5 should be programmed to their respective WRC sites. These files will need to be adapted to not
include ThingSpeak.

The logging_to_influxDB file should be used in the future to upload Chip and Colby's cellular cloud.

The how to file is a generic tutorial on how files like these work.

Files that end with a z can be ignored, but may be useful in the future.
