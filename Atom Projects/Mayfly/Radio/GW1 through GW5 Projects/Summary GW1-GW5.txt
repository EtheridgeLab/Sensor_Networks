The projects GW1 through GW5 were written to be used with EnviroDIY Mayfly 0.5b's and Xbee Radios.

With this set up, 5 Mayflys would be endpoints (with sensors connected to them) and one Mayfly would be a coordinator. The coordinator would send data to the cloud.

GW1 through GW5 are projects each for a specific Mayfly. The initial thought was that delays could be integrated into the LoggerBase.h and LoggerBase.cpp code to allow for better timing
of data.

However, this did not yield results as expected. There is still some functionality, but these programs will require some work.
